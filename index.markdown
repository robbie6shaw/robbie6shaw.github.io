I'm a third year student at the University of St. Andrews studying towards an integrated master in materials chemistry. I have an interest in electrochemistry, semiconductors and computational chemistry. I am also interested in computing science. 

In my spare time, I play both handball and golf. I also enjoy taking photos, and have a semi-regularly updated [album](photos) of them.

Below are a variety of links that you might find useful:
